What I have done:  
1.Realized all the basic function: +-รรท^ ClearAll Backspace SwitchSymbol.  
2.Add a power calculation.  
3.Used BEM for button.  
4.Always bear in mind to make sure they are number.

Implement functional flow:  
1.Recognize input before operation as num1, input between operation and equal as num2.  
2.Calculate when equalButton is pressed.  
3.Can use the result as the next num1 keep calculating.  
4.Chain operations.  
5.Only one dot can be input.

What is more to do:(learn from others in presentation)  
1.Realize keyboard input instead of click (only "C" for clear all realized).  
2.Change it into Exponential when it is overflow.
